Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection
 
1.Skills analysis:
 List Skills: 
 - Adaptability
 - Time Management
 - HTML and CSS
 - Attention to detail
 - Version Control
 - Diverse knowledge of tech, though not deap in some aspects.

 What I need to improve:
 - CSS, Expanding my foundation in styling web pages
 - Web development, adding interactive elements to web pages
 - Debugging, I need learn how to find errors in my code more efficiently
 
2.Interests and Values:

 My interest lies with computer, to put it simply. To be more precise, my interest stems with how we interact with technology.
 For example, how one would use a calculator. How does it interpret our input? What process does it do to give us the result. 
 To me this seems very fascinating. This is why i chose to study software development as the beginning of my career in IT.

 IT can be a very sophisticated field and when one is working with a team, communication is important. 
 It is also equally important to have a proper work ethic so you do not hinder the team's performance. Lastly,
 it is important to be adaptive, in order to cover aspects others may struggle in and work with code you have not used before.
 These are values I have identified and aim to work on. 

Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1.Industries and Roles Explored:
 - Cybersecurity Specialist
 - Ethical hacking, an interest field that help improve safety of websites for the public and such
 - Ai
 - Robotic engineering, like Ai, robotic engineering is rather innovative and interesting, however this requires solid knowledge of relevant other fields like physics 
 - Game Development, it was my first thought as an avid gamer. this field does require extensive range of understanding with databases and aspects like physics and design.
 - Web development
 - Software Development

2.Alignment with Personal Profile:
 Each of my skills, gained from this course and prior, have some relevance in each field. However, some do require extensive knowledge outside of my list of skills.
 Proper understanding and aplicable skills relevant to Databse management and data structure are required for cyber security, ethical hacking and AI
 A deep level of mathematical and knowledge of physics is what I lack to properly stand in Game Development, AI and Robotics.

Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1.Short-term Goals:

 - Have understanding in Javescript and Jyson
 So I can work with mobile applications
 - Have understanding of Python and C/C++
 This is to have some standing in game development, although not ideal it is more achievable.
 - Achieve my certifactes for each and have atleast 2 projects for eachaspect in my portfolio to demonstrate my skills with each language
 So I can get a job in more than one area of IT earlier, thus gain more diverse experience.
 

2.Long-term Goals:
- Land a comfortable that has me exposed to many aspects of softwar edevelopment to gain more experience and grow
- Have a good reputation and a great portfolio showcasing my many skills 
- Have aplicable skills in database management
 This is so I have qualifications for web development and a cyber security
- Gain the knowledge and qualifications to be able to work in robotic engineering and game development

Part 4: Action Plan

1.Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals:
- Understand Javascript
- Some DataBase language
- Get my Web development certicate
- Get an internship or job that aligns with my languages
- Learn C/C++ then Python
- learn Jyson
- Freelance to grow reputaion and portfolio 

2.Preparation for Long-term Goal:
- My short term Goals are more or less my ground work for my long term goals
- Get a job with good exposure to diverse opportunites to build experince
- Slowly take courses for physics and statistics for game development and AI

Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1.Anticipated Challenges*:
- I do not expect gaining qualifications for robotics, AI and game devlopment to be easy as it is a whole other field in itself, however attending objectively relvent courses may be ease the difficukty a bit

2.Opportunities for Growth:
Having any connection to a company in a certain field, like cyber security, through internship willl be very influential and somewhat cruciaal.
There are other bootcamps and relevant institutions for AI and game development that i can take in the future
